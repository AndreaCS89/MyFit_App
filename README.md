**About MyFit App:**

This repository contains the complete code and UI design for a fitness app developed by me. The app helps users monitor and track their daily fitness activities, including step count, BMI calculations, and workout logs. Users can enter their weight daily to calculate their BMI, view their progress, and log their completed workouts. 

**What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The MyFit App was developed to address the growing need for a simple, user-friendly tool that helps individuals monitor and track their daily fitness activities. Its main goals were to allow users to log workouts, track their step count, and calculate and monitor their BMI based on daily weight inputs. The app was designed to help users stay on top of their fitness goals, offering them a straightforward way to log data and visualize their progress over time.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

To support user needs, the app included several essential screens, such as a home screen with a dashboard, a BMI calculator, a workout log, and a step tracker. The UI was designed with simplicity and usability in mind, featuring intuitive navigation and minimal clutter. I prioritized ease of access to the core features, ensuring users could quickly input their data and view their progress. The clean design and focus on user-friendly interactions made the app successful in engaging users.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

When coding the MyFit App, I followed a modular approach, breaking down the app into small, manageable components. I implemented best practices such as clean coding, using clear variable names, and structuring the project logically to allow for easier debugging and future updates. This approach allowed me to compartmentalize each feature, ensuring that the app was easy to maintain. These techniques can be applied to future projects by providing a strong foundation for organizing complex apps effectively.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

I tested the MyFit App using a combination of manual and automated testing. I ran unit tests for individual components and used Android Studio’s built-in emulator to simulate user interactions across different devices. This process was crucial for ensuring the app's reliability and performance. Testing revealed some bugs related to edge cases in the BMI calculations and step tracking, which I solved to improve overall functionality and user experience.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

One of the key challenges I faced during development was giving the app more visual appeal. Initially, I attempted to enhance the dashboard by adding items and sub-items, but this approach didn’t deliver the intuitive experience I hoped for. After reconsidering the design, I decided to simplify the layout by creating four distinct buttons, each leading to different parts of the app, such as daily step count, BMI calculations, and daily fitness activities. This solution not only improved navigation but also contributed to a cleaner, more visually appealing interface, making the user experience smoother and more engaging.

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I was particularly successful in creating the MyFit App from start to finish, managing both the coding and the visual design aspects. Despite not having much prior experience in UI design, I impressed myself with how well I was able to develop a visually appealing and functional app. The process of coding the features and refining the interface taught me a lot, and I am proud of how effectively I combined both technical and design skills to deliver a user-friendly experience. This project demonstrated my ability to learn and adapt quickly while producing a polished final product.
